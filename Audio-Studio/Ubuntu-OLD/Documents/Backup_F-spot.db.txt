0. Open a terminal

1. Install sqlite
sudo apt-get install sqlite3

2. Make a backup copy of your database
cp ~/.gnome2/f-spot/photos.db ~/.gnome2/f-spot/photos.db.bak

3. Export your photos table
sqlite3 ~/.gnome2/f-spot/photos.db ".dump photos" > photos.sql

4. Edit the file with gedit
gedit photos.sql

5. Delete the second line of the photos.sql file
...CREATE TABLE photos...

6. Replace that line with
DELETE FROM photos;

7. You will see that the path for your pictures points to your old $HOME. Replace the path of your pictures in the file with your new HOME

8. Save the file and quit gedit

9. Re-import the file
sqlite3 ~/.gnome2/f-spot/photos.db < photos.sql

10. Launch f-spot. You should be an happy man now

11. If it all worked remove the backup of your database and the sql file
rm ~/.gnome2/f-spot/photos.db.bak
rm photos.sql
