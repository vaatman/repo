Chapter 1
- Containers differ from VMs by providing only the necessary runtime dependencies, such as the required application-specific libraries for a program to run, rahter, than a full operating system
- Use container images to create container instances. Container instances are executables versions of the image, and include references to networking, disks and other runtime necessities
- Podman is container engine to build and run containers on an individual host
- Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform orchestrate containers accross multiple hosts called nodes
- RHOCP is a set of modular components and services that are built on Kubernetes to add capabilities for the following features:
	- remote management
	- multiple tenants
	- increased security
	- continuous integration
	- continuous development

Chapter 2
- Use 'podman run' command to start a container
- Implement container-to-container communication using Podman networks, which include the following tasks:
	- managing podman networks by using 'podman network' subcommands
	- attaching a container to a network
- Use port-forwarding to expose a containerized process to the host environmanent
- Use the 'podman stop' or 'podman kill' commands to stop a container
- Use the 'podman ps' command to list containers
- Use the 'podman cp' command to copy files into and out of containers
- Manage the lifecycle of containers by using the 'podman start,podman pause,podman restart' and other Podman commands

Chapter 3
Summary
Use container registries to store and share container images.

Red Hat provides several container registries for both official Red Hat images and for uploading your own.

Configure container registries for Podman.

Manage container images with Podman, including the following image operations:

Listing
Pulling
Building
Pushing
Inspecting
Tagging
Removing

Chapter 4
Summary
Containerize a process by choosing a base image and by using the Containerfile instructions.

Create rootless containers by creating Containerfiles that do not run as a privileged user.

You can implement advanced container build and runtime patterns, which includes:

The use of the ENV instruction to create containers that can be deployed in different environments.

The use of the VOLUME instruction to store container data outside the container layered file system.

The use of ENTRYPOINT, CMD, and their interactions.

Creating multistage Containerfiles to build smaller images that do not contain build-time dependencies.

---
Chapter 5
Summary
Containers use a copy-on-write (COW) file system.

Containers use a thin runtime layer, which is ephemeral by default.

You can mount volumes and bind mounts to persist container data.

Some workloads, such as databases, might experience performance problems with the COW file system.

You can use Podman volumes to avoid using the COW file system.

Chapter 6
Summary
You can view logs for an application running in a container.

Using a debugger speeds up application troubleshooting.

You can attach a debugger to an application running in a container.

Chapter 7
Summary
Podman Compose is an open source tool to run Compose files.

Podman Compose removes the need to run the Podman service that provides the API socket, to save resources and to provide a more native and lightweight solution.

Podman Compose translates Compose files into Podman CLI commands.

The podman generate kube command generates a Kubernetes YAML file from existing Podman containers, pods, and volumes.

The podman play kube command reads the Kubernetes YAML file, and then recreates the defined resources in a Kubernetes or an RHOCP cluster.

You can use Podman Compose to quickly build a stateful, multi-container environment for your applications.

You can restrict communication between specific containers by defining additional networks for the pod and then defining the network settings.

You can use Podman Compose to approximate a production environment on your local machine by providing applications, databases, or cache systems configuration in a single file.

You can use Podman Compose to execute your application and database containers in isolated local environments.

Using Podman Compose in a production environment is not recommended, because it does not support advanced features that you might need in a production environment, such as load balancing and distributing containers to multiple host machines, or nodes. Instead, use Kubernetes or RHOCP for a production container orchestration solution.

Chapter 8
Summeary
Deploy applications by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) web console, or command-line utilities, such as kubectl or oc.

The smallest unit of deployment for RHOCP is a pod, which represents a group of one or multiple containers that share resources.

Use controller objects, such as Deployment, to create managed pods.

Services provide a stable IP address and a resolvable DNS name for a pod or a set of pods.

Routes expose an application outside of an RHOCP cluster.
