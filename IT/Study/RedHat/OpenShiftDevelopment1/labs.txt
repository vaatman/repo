Lab: Podman Basics
Use Podman to manage local containers.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Manage local containers.

Copy files in and out of containers.

Run a set of application containers that connect to one another via a Podman network.

Forward a port from a container so that it is accessible from the host machine.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command starts the basics-podman-secret local container, and copies the necessary files for this lab. The command also verifies that Podman is available and can pull from the required registries. You can find the source code for the basics-podman-secret container in the $HOME/DO188/solutions/basics-podman/secret-container directory.

The lab script continuously evaluates the objectives of this lab. Keep the script running in a terminal window, and complete the objectives of this lab from a new terminal window.

After each objective, return to the lab script evaluation to see if you have finished the objective successfully. When you have finished all of the objectives, the lab command prompts you to execute the finish function.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab start basics-podman
Instructions

The lab command starts the basics-podman-secret container, which contains the /etc/secret-file file.

Copy the /etc/secret-file file from the container to the $HOME/DO188/labs/basics-podman/solution file.

Start a new container with the following parameters:

Name: basics-podman-server

Image: registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/ubi8/httpd-24

Ports: Route traffic from port 8080 on your machine to port 8080 inside of the container

Network: lab-net

You can start the container in the detached mode for greater convenience.

Create the lab-net Podman network.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman network create lab-net
lab-net
The next objective of the lab script is passing.

Execute the podman run command to start the container.

[student@workstation basics-podman]$ podman run -d --name basics-podman-server \
--net lab-net -p 8080:8080 registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/ubi8/httpd-24
8b747...3616
Additional objectives of the lab script are passing.

Copy the $HOME/DO188/labs/basics-podman/index.html file to /var/www/html/ in the basics-podman-server container.

Verify that you are in the correct directory.

[student@workstation basics-podman]$ ls
index.html  solution
Copy the index.html file in to the container.

[student@workstation basics-podman]$ podman cp index.html \
basics-podman-server:/var/www/html/
In a web browser, navigate to localhost:8080 and verify that you see the Hello from Podman Basics lab text.

The next objective of the lab script is passing.

Start a new container with the following parameters:

Name: basics-podman-client

Image: registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/ubi8/httpd-24

Network: lab-net

You can start the container in the detached mode for greater convenience.

Execute the podman run command to start the container.

[student@workstation basics-podman]$ podman run -d --name basics-podman-client \
--net lab-net registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/ubi8/httpd-24
8b747...3616
Confirm that the basics-podman-client container can access the basics-podman-server container by its DNS name. Use the podman exec and curl commands to make a request to the basics-podman-server container at port 8080 from the basics-podman-client container.

Confirm that DNS is enabled on the lab-net network.

[student@workstation basics-podman]$ podman network inspect lab-net
...output omitted...
          "dns_enabled": true,
...output omitted...
Use the curl command inside of the basics-podman-client to confirm that the basics-podman-server container is accessible from the lab-net network by its DNS name.

[student@workstation basics-podman]$ podman exec basics-podman-client \
curl -s http://basics-podman-server:8080 && echo
<h1>Hello from Podman Basics lab</h1>
All remaining objectives are passing.

Lab: Custom Container Images
Complete the Containerfile for an application that generates a QR code from a given text.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Understand multistage builds.

Run commands within a container.

Set environment variables.

Set a working directory.

Set an entry point.

Change the user that executes commands.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab start custom-lab
The start command copies a Node.js application, which generates a QR code from a given text, to the labs/custom-lab directory of your workspace. The command also generates an .npmrc file that configures the Node.js application to use an internal NPM registry.

The lab script continuously evaluates the objectives of this lab. Keep the script running in a terminal window and complete the objectives of this lab from a new terminal window.

The application contains a Containerfile that you must complete throughout this exercise. The Containerfile uses a multistage build. The first stage uses the registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-certificate-generator image to generate self-signed certificates.

In the second stage, the application uses the certificates to enable a TLS connection.

Instructions

Navigate to the ~/DO188/labs/custom-lab directory, which contains the application that converts a text into a QR code image. Then, run the app on the host machine by using the npm install and npm start commands. Verify that the application fails gracefully because an environment variable is missing.

Navigate to the ~/DO188/labs/custom-lab directory.

[student@workstation ~]$ cd ~/DO188/labs/custom-lab
no output expected
Install the application dependencies.

[student@workstation custom-lab]$ npm install

Chapter 5
Lab: Persisting Data
Use volumes to provide persistence to an application.

Outcomes

You should be able to create volumes, import data into volumes, and use volumes in an application.

This lab uses a URL shortener application, which consists of three components: a database container, a back-end container, and a front-end container.

The source code for the front end and back end is available at ~/DO188/solutions/persisting-lab after you execute the lab script.

Note the following:

The back-end container uses the following information:

The back end uses default values for the user, password, and database for simplicity.

The back end uses the database container name to resolve the database IP address. Do not change the database container name.

The front-end container uses the following information:

The front end uses an Nginx server to redirect requests from localhost:8080 to the persisting-backend:8080 host. Do not change the back-end container name.

If the front end exits after start, execute podman logs persisting-frontend to check the logs.

The application can become unresponsive after you stop individual containers. If this happens, stop all containers and start the containers in order of database, back end, and front end.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab start persisting-lab
The lab script continuously evaluates the objectives of this lab. Keep the script running in a terminal window and complete the objectives of this lab from a new terminal window.

Instructions

Chapter 6
Lab: Troubleshooting Containers
Troubleshoot the quotes-api application.

The application consists of the following components:

The quotes-api-v1 service with the v1 quotes API version.

The quotes-api-v2 service with the v2 quotes API version.

The quotes-ui service, which accepts the quotes API version as an environment variable.

The quotes-ui container starts an NGINX proxy that performs the following tasks:

Serves the web application.

Acts as a reverse proxy to route the UI requests to the version specified in the QUOTES_API_VERSION environment variable.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Check container logs.

Run container commands.

Troubleshoot container networking problems.

Configure containers by using environment variables.

Configure containers by overriding container configuration files with host files.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command deploys the quotes application in a non-working state. You must troubleshoot and fix the application.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab start troubleshooting-lab
The lab script continuously evaluates the objectives of this lab. Keep the script running in a terminal window and complete the objectives of this lab from a new terminal window.

Instructions

Verify that the following containers are running with the following configuration:

quotes-api-v1 and quotes-api-v2
Container image: registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/wiremock

quotes-ui
Port mapping: 3000:8080

Container image: registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/quotes-ui-versioning:1.0

Environment variable: QUOTES_API_VERSION=v2

If any of the containers are missing, then read the container logs to determine what is preventing the container from starting. Then, fix the issue and start the container.

Use the following troubleshooting guide to identify and fix the problems:

Problem: unable to retrieve auth token: invalid username/password: unauthorized
Solution: You must log into the image registry.

Problem: requires at least 1 arg(s), only received 0
Solution: Correct your Podman command.

Problem: nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream
Solution: Nginx reverse proxy cannot resolve hostname to IP address, probably due to a missing Podman network.
Run the podman ps command with the -a option to show stopped containers.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE              COMMAND CREATED   STATUS    PORTS NAMES
b72652504844  ...wiremock:latest         28 sec... Up...           quotes-api-v1
a3a2f6809446  ...wiremock:latest         27 sec... Up...           quotes-api-v2
867f6f559629  ...quotes-ui-ve... /bin... 21 sec... Exited... 0...  quotes-ui
The quotes-ui container failed to start.

Read the quotes-ui logs with the podman logs command to look for container start-up errors.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman logs quotes-ui
nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream "quotes-api-v1" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:45
The container fails to start because the NGINX proxy in the quotes-ui container cannot resolve the quotes-api-v1 hostname to an IP address.

Use the podman inspect command to determine the Podman networks that the containers use to communicate.

Inspect the quotes-api-v1 networks.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman inspect \
  quotes-api-v1 --format='{{.NetworkSettings.Networks}}'
map[troubleshooting-lab:0xc000a825a0]
Inspect the quotes-api-v2 networks.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman inspect \
  quotes-api-v2 --format='{{.NetworkSettings.Networks}}'
map[troubleshooting-lab:0xc000a825a0]
Repeat the command for the quotes-ui container.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman inspect \
  quotes-ui --format='{{.NetworkSettings.Networks}}'
map[]
The quotes-ui container is missing the troubleshooting-lab network and thus it cannot resolve the quotes-api-v1 and quotes-api-v2 host names.

Remove the current quotes-ui container.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman rm quotes-ui
093a...cf4a
Recreate the quotes-ui container and attach it to the troubleshooting-lab network.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman run -d \
  --name quotes-ui -p 3000:8080 \
  -e QUOTES_API_VERSION=v2 \
  --net troubleshooting-lab \
  registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/quotes-ui-versioning:1.0
d838...7432
Verify that the quotes-ui container starts.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE              COMMAND CREATED     STATUS  PORTS NAMES
b72652504844  ...wiremock:latest          28 sec...  Up...         quotes-api-v1
a3a2f6809446  ...wiremock:latest          27 sec...  Up...         quotes-api-v2
6e8581a9d73b  ...quotes-ui-versioning:1.0 1 sec...   Up...         quotes-ui
Ensure that the NGINX reverse proxy can route requests to both versions of the quotes API.

The NGINX reverse proxy in the quotes-ui container should route requests as indicated in the following table:

Table 6.1. NGINX mappings

From	To
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/quotes	http://quotes-api-v1:8080/api/v1/quotes
http://localhost:8080/api/v2/quotes	http://quotes-api-v2:8081/api/v2/quotes

The quotes-ui logs provide some network information that you might need.

Perform any configuration modifications in the quotes-ui container.

Use a bind mount to replace the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file in the quotes-ui container with a modified ~/DO188/labs/troubleshooting-lab/nginx.conf file, if necessary.

Use the podman exec command to run the curl command from the quotes-ui container to test the v1 and v2 mappings. Use the localhost host name to test the NGINX mappings. Use the silent option (-s) with the curl command to print the output only.

Test that the v1 mapping works.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman exec quotes-ui \
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/quotes

This error means that NGINX was able to map the request but did not get a response from the quotes-api-v2 service.

Investigate if the quotes-api-v2 service is using a different port. Run the podman logs command on the quotes-api-v2 container to find the port that the service is using.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman logs quotes-api-v2
...output omitted...
port:                         8081
...output omitted...
The quotes-api-v2 service is using the 8081 port.

Read the quotes-ui container NGINX configuration file at the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf path.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman exec quotes-ui \
  cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
...output omitted...
    location /api/v2 {
        rewrite /api/v2/(.*) /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://quotes-api-v2:8080;
    }
...output omitted...
The mapping for v2 is redirecting requests to the http://quotes-api-v2:8080 address, which points to the wrong port.

Read the updated copy of the NGINX configuration at ~/DO188/labs/troubleshooting-lab/nginx.conf.

[student@workstation ~]$ cat ~/DO188/labs/troubleshooting-lab/nginx.conf
...output omitted...
    location /api/v2 {
        rewrite /api/v2/(.*) /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://quotes-api-v2:8081;
    }
...output omitted...
This version points to the right 8081 port.

Remove the quotes-ui container by running podman rm using the -f option.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman rm -f quotes-ui
d838...7432
Recreate the quotes-ui container. Override the container's /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file with the ~/DO188/labs/troubleshooting-lab/nginx.conf file by using a bind mount with the :Z option.

[student@workstation ~]$ podman run -d \
  --name quotes-ui \
  -p 3000:8080 \
  -e QUOTES_API_VERSION=v2 \
  --net troubleshooting-lab \

Lab: Multi-container Applications with Compose
Create a compose file to deploy your application in a testing environment. The application uses three components: a UI, a back end, and an external service that the back end uses. Because the development team does not own the external service, they decided to use a mock server called Wiremock to mock the external service interactions with the back end.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Create a multi-container compose file with the following features:

Bind mounts

Environment variables

Networks

Published ports

Reload the compose file after modifying it.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab start compose-lab
The start function copies a file called compose.yaml that you must complete throughout this exercise. It also copies the configuration for wiremock to mock the quotes-provider service.

The lab script continuously evaluates the objectives of this lab. Keep the script running in a terminal window and complete the objectives of this lab from a new terminal window.

Instructions

Change into the ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab directory. This directory contains the compose file called compose.yaml, which you must complete. Then, start the containers in the background.

Container Name	Image
quotes-provider	registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/wiremock
quotes-api	registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-quotesapi-compose
quotes-ui	registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-quotes-ui
Note
The WireMock container image provides the ability to create a fake API service. This exercise uses this image to run the quotes-provider API. In a real-world scenario, your API image is built from your application source code.

Change into the ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab directory.

[student@workstation compose-lab]$ cd ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab
no output expected
Update the compose.yaml file to look like the following code block:

services:
  wiremock:
    container_name: "quotes-provider"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/wiremock"
  quotes-api:
    container_name: "quotes-api"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-quotesapi-compose"
  quotes-ui:
    container_name: "quotes-ui"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-quotes-ui"
From the directory that contains the compose.yaml file, run podman-compose up to create the containers. Use the -d option to run the containers in the background.

[student@workstation compose-lab]$ podman-compose up -d
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: ...
** excluding:  set()
...output omitted...
Configure the quotes-provider mock service by providing the Wiremock mappings and responses in the ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab/wiremock/stubs directory.

Wiremock expects two directories to configure the mock server:

mappings: contains files that define the HTTP endpoints.

__files: contains files with fixed responses.

To provide the Wiremock configuration, mount the ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab/wiremock/stubs directory as the /home/wiremock directory in the container.

To apply the changes, delete and restart the containers by using the podman-compose command.

Use a bind mount to map ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab/wiremock/stubs to the /home/wiremock directory. Provide the Z option to add the correct SELinux permissions.

services:
  wiremock:
    container_name: "quotes-provider"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/wiremock"
    volumes:
      - ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab/wiremock/stubs:/home/wiremock:Z
  quotes-api:
    container_name: "quotes-api"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-quotesapi-compose"
  quotes-ui:
    container_name: "quotes-ui"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/podman-quotes-ui"
Apply the changes by running the podman-compose down command followed by podman-compose up -d.

Run podman-compose down to stop and remove the containers in the compose.yaml file.

[student@workstation compose-lab]$ podman-compose down
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: ...
** excluding:  set()
podman stop -t 10 quotes-ui
quotes-ui

Isolate together the quotes-provider and quotes-api services by creating a Podman network called lab-net in the compose.yaml file.

To apply the changes, delete and restart the containers by using the podman-compose command.

Use the networks top-level property to create the lab-net network from the compose.yaml file. Then use the networks property under the wiremock and quotes-api services to connect both containers to the lab-net network.

services:
  wiremock:
    container_name: "quotes-provider"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/wiremock"
    volumes:
      - ~/DO188/labs/compose-lab/wiremock/stubs:/home/wiremock:Z

The quotes-api and quotes-provider services share a network, but the quotes-api service is missing the hostname configuration of the provider endpoint. Set the QUOTES_SERVICE environment variable to configure the quotes-provider URL. Use the default name resolution, the quotes-provider configuration, the http protocol, and the port 8080 to configure this value.

To apply the changes, delete and restart the containers by using the podman-compose command.

Add the QUOTES_SERVICE="http://quotes-provider:8080" environment variable to the compose.yaml file.

services:
  wiremock:
    container_name: "quotes-provider"
    image: "registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/wiremock"
